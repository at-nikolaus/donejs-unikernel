## What are the Concepts behind Unikernels?
It Creates a Bundle with a Minimal OS to get your Application up and Running so that you can deploy it to bare metal or the cloud without additional steps and configuration managment so you can focus on your application and forget about the underlaying userland of the Operating System as your Application is the Userland.

if your not familar with all the parts of a Operating System and your a Docker or Moby User this is exactly what you want.
you abstract the Administration effort for extra Operating Systems away and all the security stuff. I will talk about that in one of my Videos later.
